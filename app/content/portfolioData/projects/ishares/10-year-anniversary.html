    <p class="intro">
        Simple solutions are not always easy, but there is always a way. It takes years of experience to find simple solutions in complex problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Create an automated / interactive timeline for the iShares 10 year anniversary.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br />
        Year over year, there is an underlying report on iShares AUM (Assets Under Management). As the time line transitions through each year, the AUM moves along the line and brings the user view with it. As each year comes into view, the events from that year are displayed to show the progress of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Technologies:</b><br />
        Flash AS3, MVC architecture. XML data for each year. Procedural motion design.

    <p class="intro">
        These were the constraints provided by the flash ad world, which left no room for mistakes. I love a good challenge, and this is one I'm particularly good at.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Create a Flash promo ad for iShares, to briefly take over the Yahoo! home page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br/>
        I've cut my teeth creating programmatic animations with Flash / Action Script 3. This entire animation is procedurally generated, which was literally the only way to meet the insane limitations for Flash ads in general. This was before animation frameworks became a thing, as a result of the necessity to create them.
