    <h2>I built this from scratch...</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        <em>&</em> I like learning new things, all the time. I decided to hire myself to build a portfolio for myself. Then I managed myself to achieve this outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote user stories, and prioritized an MVP. I researched new tools, and simplified my approach to something I could achieve in short order. Although, truly, I've taken the time to show the breadth of my experience and all that I have learned.
    </p>
    <h2>I made assumptions about what a portfolio should be.</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Build myself a portfolio, that encompasses years of work in a quick and easy to use presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br />
        Well, you're looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Application:</b><br />
        As a developer, I have always had an eye for good design, and how to build it. Here, I have taken everything I know, and boiled it down to this.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Technologies:</b><br />
        Primarily, this site is built with Angular JS, CSS, HTML, JSON, + NODE JS for testing. The git library is <a href="https://github.com/IllEagle23/portfolio">here</a>. Instructions are simple enough to get it set up locally with node js. I've created unit & e2e tests for validation of expectations. I use webstorm as my IDE, and I've configured the project to automate a lot of tasks with grunt.
