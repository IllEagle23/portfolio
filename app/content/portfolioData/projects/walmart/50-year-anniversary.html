    <h2>Decades of progress, summed up in minutes.</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        It's late 2011, Walmart is about to celebrate their 50th anniversary of the founding of the company by Sam Walton in 1962.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Create animated / interactive time line for Walmart's 50th anniversary.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br/>
        Simple flash MVC architecture for UI with restful API that returns xml for application data. There are five different view types, each of which takes unique data points and animates them into and out of frame. The timeline is broken up into either whole decades, or "early" and "late" decade periods. For example, there is one section for 1960's, but two sections for early and late 1970's, respectively. Each section has three total views of the five available.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gird view being the most complex, as the layout was determined by the data returned from the api. Position, width, height, color, and content of each grid item were determined by the xml nodes.
