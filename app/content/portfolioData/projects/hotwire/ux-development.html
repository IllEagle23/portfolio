    <h2>Creating intuitive UX for complex business problems is hard AF.</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Angular JS is a great tool for building quick prototypes that can be tested with end users to validate (or invalidate) UX concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Create mobile prototypes for iOS and Android app user-testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br />
        In my first few months at Hotwire, I created over 2 dozen prototypes. Each one becoming progressively more complex in features and capabilities. Rather quickly, I was promoted to lead the UX development team and create the process to develop prototypes for in house user-testing and research.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Technologies:</b><br />
        Angular, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Python, JSON.
