# Portfolio app
_A quick and dirty Front End Development starter project to create a simple UI from json data._

# Run the project with nodejs
* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
* Run `npm start` to install all the node_modules and app/bower_components package dependencies for running the app and dev env.
* Once all the dependencies are installed npm will automatically start a basic web server for hosting the app.
* The app will then be accessible in your browser at localhost:8000 [here](http://localhost:8000/).
* If you have another host running at localhost:8000 already this project server will not start.
* If started successfully, the server will continue to run until you close your terminal or stop the process with "command" + "period".
