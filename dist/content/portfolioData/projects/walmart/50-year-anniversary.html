    <h2>From the big picture, to the subtle details.</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        In 2012, Walmart was celebrating their 50th anniversary of the founding of the company by Sam Walton in 1962.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Create animated / interactive time line for Walmart's 50th anniversary.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br/>
        Simple flash MVC architecture for UI with restful API that returns xml for application data. There are 5 different view types, each of which takes unique data points and animates them into and out of frame. The timeline is broken up into either decade or "early" and "late" decade periods. For example, there is one section for 1960's, but 2 sections for early and late 1970's. Each section has 3 total views of the 5 available.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gird view being the most complex, as the layout was determined by the data returned from the api.
