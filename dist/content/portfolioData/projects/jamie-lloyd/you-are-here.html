    <h2>I made assumptions about what a portfolio should be.</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Then I wrote user stories, and prioritized an MVP. I researched <i>everything</i>, and simplified as I went. My desire was to create something I could achieve quickly without sacrificing the quality i've come to expect. But also to make it scalable and easy to add new features later.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Build myself a portfolio that encompasses years of work in a quick and easy to use presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution:</b><br />
        As a developer, i've always had an eye for good designs and how to build them. Here, i've taken what I know and boiled it down into this presentation. The video's of each work sample were recorded with the intention to show the work the way I see it, for quick consumption and browsing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Technologies:</b><br />
        Primarily, this site is built with Angular JS, CSS, HTML, JSON, + Node JS for testing with Karma and Protractor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Git library:</b><br />
        You can find the git library <a target="_new" analytics-on="click" href="https://github.com/IllEagle23/portfolio">here</a>. It contains everything you need to run the app, with the exception of the video files. You can download those <a target="_new" analytics-on="click" href="http://jamielloyd.info/video.zip">here</a> if you want to run it locally. I've written instructions in the git readme file <a target="_new" analytics-on="click" href="https://github.com/IllEagle23/portfolio/blob/master/README.md">here</a> to help get you started. Instructions are simple enough to get it set up. A familiarity with git, node, grunt is assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Workflow:</b><br />
        I use Webstorm as my IDE, and I've configured the project to automate important tasks. There are unit & e2e tests for quick validation of underlying expectations. Grunt tasks for file watching, concatenation, minification, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Known issues:</b><br />
        Currently the play button fade-in is triggered by the video player pause event. Click and hold the seek bar while a video is playing, and the play button fades-in over the top. The pause event is fired, and the seek event does not fire until the seek head is moved. It's not exactly broken, just doesn't look ideal.

        <b>Pending updates:</b><br />
        Database solution for project and case study data.
