    <h2>From the big picture, to the subtle details.</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Back when Flash / Action Script was still cool, I had the distinct pleasure of working with Whittman Hart in L.A. on a project to overhaul the Budweiser online presence. The Creative Director was a good friend, and we had a blast working on the conceptual development together.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Request:</b><br/>
        Make Dale Earnhardt Jr. look bad ass in an interactive rich media promo for Budweiser.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pitch:</b><br />
        My initial take was to simulate Dale Jr’s Monte Carlo racing around the track from various camera angles, then randomly stitch together a set of 3 short video clips from a pool of about 20 or so clips. As you click through the 4 racing dials on the bottom the app will choose 3 clips from the pool again, and create a video backdrop for an animated transition. Premium eye candy.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the pitch we used a model Toyota FJ Cruiser from Chris’s desk to help visualize camera angles and movement. It just happened to be what he had. My goal was to create the feeling of the viewer moving quickly alongside the car while the car moved quickly in view. Getting the adrenaline pumping.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pre-visualisation:</b><br />
        To get this off the ground we bought an electric race car set and filmed the car flying around the track from various angles while moving the camera as well. We stitched together a few shots and loved the outcome. With these shots in hand, we hired a 3D animator to create the video clips as seen in the promo. Textures, brand colors, and lighting were added later as each shot was approved.
    </p>
    <h2>The rush you feel when the race is about to start.</h2>
    <p>
        We open on a Budweiser branded speed dial. We want the user to feel urgency, a race is about to start. This is what they are here for. It’s going to be epic. The animation needs to portray speed, despite the user needing to wait for the files to load. As the app loads, the loading bar fills in with branding color.
    </p>
    <p>
        When ready, the screen pops with a motion mask to reveal the Budweiser branding of Dale Jr's Monte Carlo. There are several motion mask designs that the app chooses from at random to create a unique feel each time it’s used.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Good Year tires are getting bolted on. Dale encourages the pit crew (and us) over the radio. The camera swings around the car dramatically. They are ready to race, and we are ready to watch.
    </p>
    <h2>As Dale Jr's race car takes off, we get taken
        with it.</h2>
    <p>
        With a few twists and turns around the track, we finally land on our backdrop for the UI, where a set of panels animate to dim the scene. Each piece of the UI is animated in succession. So many subtle details. Even in the UI we wanted to portray the feeling of intensity and speed. With Dale Jr. as the main focus, it wasn’t hard to project. All in all it was a really fun project to work on. Budweiser is such an iconic America brand. Plus I love their logo. Click on it below to launch the archived flash site. Some of the fine detail is getting lost in the video so check it out.
