        This site never went public, and the big celebration never happened. At the time, there were reports of the bridge re-opening being delayed due to construction issues, reported <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Fears-of-failure-grow-for-rods-on-Bay-Bridge-6588743.php">here</a>. The celebration plans were subsequently scrapped along with all the work we did on the site.
